VS 2017 Git Local Commit DB.lock error on every commit

This issue must have been caused by a corrupt .ignore file.

If your IDE is Visual Studio please follow these steps to resolve this issue:

Delete the .gitignore file from your project folder
Go to Team Explorer
Go to Home in Team Explorer
Go to Settings
Under GIT, Click Repository Settings
Under - Ignore & Attributes Files - Under Ignore File - Click Add. You should see a notification that the Ignore File has been successfully created
Build your solution. It will take a little while and create a new .ignore file once build is successful
You should now be able to Commit and Push without any further issue
NB: Bear in mind that your version of visual studio might place these options differently. I am using Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition.
